### hi !! i'm frérot
welcome to my github profile! i'm passionate about technology, coding, and building cool projects. i enjoy learning new things and experimenting with different tools, that's how i learnt to code.


#### 👷 The latest repos I've pushed to (public)

- [`dbms-assign`](https://github.com/frer0t/dbms-assign) - _"Database Management Assignment 1"_ **(6 days ago)**
- [`site`](https://github.com/frer0t/site) - _"this is my digital playground where i show off cool stuff i've made, talk about what i know, and share my professional journey. think of it as my little home on the internet where you can learn all about me and my work!"_ **(6 days ago)**
